# Oregon Trail Decompilation Project Rules

## Project Patterns

1. **Naming Conventions**: 
   - All converter tools use `convert_X.py` naming pattern
   - Module-level functions use snake_case
   - Classes use PascalCase
   - Constants use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

2. **Command-line Interface**:
   - All converter tools accept consistent command-line parameters:
     - Input directory/file
     - Output directory
     - Optional --debug flag
   - Parameters should remain consistent across all tools

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Converters should skip files they can't process rather than halt
   - Debug logs should be comprehensive when enabled
   - User-facing errors should be clear and actionable

4. **File Organization**:
   - Original DOS game files stored in `/original_game/`
   - Original extracted files remain in `/raw_extracted/`
   - Converted files go to `/modern/` with appropriate subdirectory
   - Documentation maintained in `/docs/`
   - Conversion tools stored in `/tools/`

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Addition Process**:
   - Document the feature/format first
   - Implement converter/feature
   - Add tests
   - Update documentation
   - Verify against original game

2. **Format Conversion Standards**:
   - Maintain as much original fidelity as possible
   - Document any conversion limitations
   - Prefer widely supported modern formats
   - Include descriptive metadata when possible

3. **Game Implementation Guidelines**:
   - Match original game mechanics exactly
   - Maintain original asset appearance
   - Use identical text/dialog
   - Match original UI flow

## Known Challenges & Solutions

1. **XMI Conversion**:
   - Miles Sound System uses custom MIDI-like format
   - Note events include their own duration rather than matching NOTE ON/OFF
   - Solution: Convert duration to appropriate NOTE OFF events
   - TIMB chunks contain custom instrument mappings

2. **Image Color Palettes**:
   - PC8/PC4 files use custom palettes
   - 16-color palettes are stored in file header
   - 256-color palettes are at end of file after 0x0C marker
   - Solution: Extract and apply palette during PNG conversion

3. **Animation Frame Timing**:
   - Original animations lack clear frame timing
   - Solution: Estimate based on animation speed in original game
   - May need manual adjustment for some animations

4. **Game Data Formats**:
   - GBT/GFT formats are proprietary with no documentation
   - Structure must be reverse-engineered from binary analysis
   - Solution: Careful study of patterns and relation to game behavior

## Project Preferences

1. **Code Style**:
   - Clear, descriptive variable names
   - Comprehensive docstrings
   - Type hints where possible
   - Function-level comments for complex algorithms

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Unit tests for format parsers
   - Integration tests for converters
   - Visual verification for converted assets
   - Game state tests for implementation

3. **Documentation Style**:
   - Technical format specifications with examples
   - Diagrams for complex structures
   - Header tables for file formats
   - Cross-references to related formats/files

## Debug & Troubleshooting

1. **Conversion Debugging**:
   - Enable --debug flag for verbose logging
   - xmi_debug.log contains detailed XMI parsing information
   - Check docs/ directory for format-specific debugging notes
   - Compare converted files against original format specifications

2. **Game Implementation**:
   - Run original game in DOSBox-X for comparison
   - Use different starting conditions to test varied scenarios
   - Check asset loading errors in game startup
   - Test menu navigation edge cases

## Critical Implementation Paths

1. **Asset Loading Pipeline**:
   - Assets must be correctly converted before running the game
   - Image paths are hardcoded based on expected directory structure
   - Sound and music depend on pygame mixer initialization
   - Font loading requires correctly converted font assets

2. **Game State Flow**:
   - State machine controls all navigation
   - Each state has specific entry/exit conditions
   - State handlers manage all drawing and input for their state
   - Game loop ticks at fixed 60 FPS for consistent timing
