# Project Brief: Oregon Trail Decompilation

## Project Goal
This project aims to decompile "The Oregon Trail" (1995 MECC version), providing tools to extract and convert the game's assets from proprietary formats to modern, accessible formats. This enables preservation, study, and potential reimplementation of the game.

## Core Components
1. **Extraction Tools**: Scripts to extract assets from the original GXL archive
2. **Format Converters**: Specialized tools for converting each proprietary file format:
   - PC8/PC4/PCX images → PNG
   - XMI music → MIDI
   - SND audio → WAV
   - CTR/Text files → UTF-8
   - ANI animations → Modern format
   - GBT/GFT files → Modern format

3. **Documentation**: Technical documentation of proprietary formats

## Objectives
1. Complete extraction of all game assets
2. Accurate format conversion while preserving original fidelity
3. Thorough documentation of all file formats

## Success Criteria
- All asset files correctly extracted and converted
- Accurate documentation of all file formats

## Out of Scope
- Feature enhancements beyond the original game
- Distribution of original copyrighted assets
