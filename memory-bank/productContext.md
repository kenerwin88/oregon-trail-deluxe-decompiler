# Product Context: Oregon Trail Decompilation

## Background
The Oregon Trail is a classic educational game originally created by MECC (Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium) in 1971 with numerous versions released over the years. The 1995 DOS version is a significant iteration with rich graphics, sound, and enhanced gameplay over earlier text-based versions.

## Why This Project Exists
1. **Preservation**: The original game requires obsolete hardware/software (DOS) to run, making it increasingly inaccessible.
2. **Education**: Understanding the game's internal structure provides valuable learning opportunities for developers.
3. **Accessibility**: Converting to modern formats allows broader access to this educational classic.
4. **Technical Understanding**: Reverse engineering proprietary formats advances knowledge of mid-90s game development techniques.

## Problems This Project Solves
1. **Format Obsolescence**: Converts proprietary formats that modern systems cannot interpret.
2. **Technical Barriers**: Eliminates need for DOS emulation to access game assets.
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Provides technical documentation for previously undocumented formats.
4. **Preservation Risk**: Safeguards game content against format obsolescence and bit rot.

## How It Works
1. **Asset Extraction**: Python tools extract assets from the original GXL archive.
2. **Format Conversion**: Specialized converters transform each format to modern equivalents:
   - PC8/PC4/PCX → PNG (images)
   - XMI → MIDI (music)
   - SND → WAV (sound)
   - CTR/TXT → UTF-8 (text)
   - ANI → Modern formats (animations)
   - GBT/GFT → Modern formats (game data)
3. **Documentation**: Detailed analysis of each format with specifications.
4. **Modern Reimplementation**: Progressive development of a modern game engine using converted assets.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Developers**:
   - Clear documentation of formats and algorithms
   - Well-organized, modular codebase for analysis and extension
   - Comprehensive tools for working with game assets

2. **Preservationists**:
   - Complete set of converted assets in modern formats
   - Accurate reproduction of original experience

3. **Educators/Students**:
   - Access to historical educational content
   - Understanding of technical evolution in educational software

## Success Metrics
1. **Conversion Completeness**: All game assets properly extracted and converted
2. **Format Documentation**: Complete technical specifications for all formats
4. **Community Adoption**: Usage by researchers, educators and preservation community
