WELCOME TO THE OREGON TRAIL!Here are a few tidbits of information that may smooth your path on
The Oregon Trail.
The Oregon Trail 3.0 requires a VGA video adapter, Microsoft or
100% compatible mouse and a minimum of 475K free memory.  You will
need a minimum of 515K free memory if you want to turn the sound on.
On some video adapters with 512K or more memory, an enhanced video
mode is used to display more colors.  If you seem to be having
problems with the video mode that The Oregon Trail uses, you can
force it to use the normal 16 color VGA mode by typing "OREGON -16"
to launch the program.
When running under Microsoft Windows, you may experience problems
with the sound drivers.  You may want to use "OREGON -CONFIGURE" to
turn the sound off if you will be using it under Windows.
Thank you for purchasing The Oregon Trail. We hope you enjoy the
program as much as we enjoyed creating it for you.
