# Product Context: Oregon Trail Deluxe Rewrite (Rust Trail)

## Purpose

### Why This Project Exists
The Oregon Trail Deluxe (1995) is a culturally significant educational game that has both historical and nostalgic value. However, as technology evolves, running the original software becomes increasingly difficult on modern systems. This rewrite aims to preserve this important educational tool and make it accessible to current and future generations through modern technology.

### Problems It Solves
1. **Preservation**: The original game is becoming difficult to run on modern operating systems, risking loss of this cultural artifact.
2. **Accessibility**: By rewriting in Rust with Macroquad, the game becomes available on all modern platforms, including web browsers.
3. **Maintainability**: The original codebase (written in older technologies) is difficult to maintain or extend. The rewrite uses modern Rust practices for improved maintainability.
4. **Technical Limitations**: Original game had technical constraints that modern hardware can overcome while maintaining the authentic experience.
