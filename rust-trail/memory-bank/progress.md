### Overall Completion
- **Foundation Phase**: ~30% complete
- **Overall Project**: ~10% complete

## What Works

### Functional Components
1. **Game Initialization**
   - Application starts up successfully
   - Window created with proper title
   - Game state initialized

2. **Asset Loading**
   - Texture loading from assets/images directory
   - Asset caching system to prevent duplicate loading
   - Path resolution for different asset types

3. **State Management**
   - Transitions between basic game states (Title, Introduction, Options, MainMenu)
   - State-specific update and render logic
   - Exit handling

4. **Basic Navigation**
   - Title screen loads and displays
   - Placeholder screens for Introduction, Options, and MainMenu
   - Navigation between these screens via keyboard/mouse

## What's Left to Build

### High Priority
1. **Complete UI Components**
   - Finish button implementation with proper visuals and interactions
   - Implement additional UI elements (menus, dialogs, text input)
   - Create consistent UI styling that matches original

2. **Implement Core Game Logic**
   - Finish player state management
   - Implement party member system and management
   - Create complete inventory and resource tracking
   - Implement game progression tracking

3. **Additional Engine Systems**
   - Audio system for sound effects and music
   - Complete rendering system for consistent visuals
   - Input handling system for cross-platform support
   - Save/load functionality

### Medium Priority
1. **Game Screens**
   - Complete main menu implementation
   - Add game setup/configuration screens
   - Implement travel interface and visualization
   - Create event screens and interactions

2. **Game Mechanics**
   - Travel and movement system
   - Resource consumption mechanics
   - Time and calendar system
   - Weather effects

### Lower Priority
1. **Mini-games**
   - Hunting interface and mechanics
   - River crossing challenges
   - Trading interface and economic system

2. **Polish and Extensions**
   - Animations and visual effects
   - Enhanced audio with music
   - Accessibility improvements
   - Additional features beyond original game

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. ~~**Build Errors**: Fixed incorrect import path and variable shadowing issues~~ (FIXED)
2. **Asset Loading**: Error handling could be improved for missing assets
3. **Scene System**: Current implementation is basic and needs expansion
4. **Game States**: Some placeholder screens lack proper content/functionality
5. **Rendering**: No dedicated renderer component yet

### Implementation Gaps
1. **Incomplete Title Screen**: Needs animations and proper button interactions
2. **Missing Audio**: No sound effects or music implementation
3. **Placeholder UI**: Many screens are just placeholders without actual functionality
4. **Limited Input Handling**: No comprehensive input system for different platforms

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design
- State machine approach for game flow
- Module-based code organization
- Macroquad for cross-platform graphics

### Refinements
- Added asset caching to improve performance
- Implemented separate scene components for better organization
- Created reusable Button component for consistent UI

### Future Considerations
- Evaluate more comprehensive UI framework vs. custom implementation
- Consider more efficient asset loading for web deployment
- Assess need for additional dependencies for audio and advanced features

## Current Development Phase
The project is currently in the **Foundation Phase (Phase 1)** according to the development roadmap, focused on establishing the core architecture and basic functionality before implementing detailed game mechanics.

## Next Milestone Goals
1. Complete title screen with full functionality
2. Implement main menu with all options
3. Create game setup/configuration screens
4. Establish basic travel screen layout

## Additional Notes
- Asset conversion from original game formats is being handled separately
- Focus is currently on establishing core architecture before detailed mechanics
- Cross-platform testing (especially web) will be needed as features develop
