# Active Context: Oregon Trail Deluxe Rewrite (Rust Trail)

## Current Work Focus

### Active Development Areas
The project is currently in the early foundation phase, focusing on establishing the core architecture and basic game functionality:

1. **Core Engine Setup**
   - Basic game loop established
   - State management system implemented
   - Asset loading framework in place for textures
   - Placeholder screens for navigation
   - Build system fixed and running successfully

2. **Scene Implementation**
   - Title screen implementation in progress
   - Button component created for UI elements
   - Navigation between basic screens (Title, Introduction, Options, MainMenu)

3. **Game Logic Foundations**
   - Initial player and inventory systems defined
   - Core game state management structure established

## Recent Changes

### Latest Implementation Progress
1. Implemented basic `Game` struct with state management
2. Created `AssetManager` for loading and caching game assets
3. Added initial scene structure with placeholder screens
4. Established navigation between title screen and other basic screens
5. Set up project structure with module organization
6. Fixed build errors:
   - Corrected import paths in game.rs (`title` â†’ `title_screen`)
   - Fixed color constants in title_screen.rs (replaced undefined `DARKRED` with `MAROON`)
   - Resolved variable shadowing issues with screen dimensions

### Technical Decisions Made
1. Adopted state machine pattern for game screen management
2. Implemented asset caching system to optimize performance
3. Chose scene-based architecture for screen management
4. Created reusable UI components starting with Button

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Complete Title Screen Implementation**
   - Finalize button interactions and visual effects
   - Add animations for title screen elements
   - Implement proper transitions to other screens

2. **Implement Main Menu Functionality**
   - Create interactive menu options
   - Add visual styling matching original game
   - Implement navigation to game setup screens

3. **Develop Core Game Logic**
   - Complete player state management
   - Implement party member system
   - Create inventory and resource tracking

4. **Add Missing Engine Components**
   - Implement audio system for sound effects and music
   - Create dedicated renderer for consistent visuals
   - Add input handling system for cross-platform input

### Short-term Goals
1. Have a fully functional navigation flow from title screen through main menu
2. Implement the game setup/configuration screens
3. Create the basic travel mechanics
4. Implement resource management systems

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Design Questions
1. **Asset Loading Strategy**
   - How to optimize asset loading to minimize memory usage?
   - Should we implement background loading for larger assets?
   - When to load vs. unload assets during state transitions?

2. **UI Component Design**
   - How to balance authentic original UI with improved usability?
   - What level of UI component abstraction is appropriate?
   - How to handle different screen resolutions while maintaining original look?

3. **Game State Management**
   - What is the most efficient way to handle complex state transitions?
   - How to manage shared state between different game screens?
   - How to implement save/load functionality for game state?

### Current Challenges
1. Recreating exact behavior of the original game without source code
2. Balancing authentic experience with modern improvements
3. Managing assets efficiently across different platforms
4. Ensuring cross-platform compatibility, especially for web

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns in Use
1. **Asset Access Pattern**
   ```rust
   // Assets loaded by name and cached
   let texture = asset_manager.load_texture("TITLE.png").await?;
   ```

2. **State Transition Pattern**
   ```rust
   // Explicit state transition with logging
   self.transition_to(GameState::MainMenu);
   ```

3. **Component Rendering Pattern**
   ```rust
   // Each component handles its own rendering
   title_screen.draw();
   ```

4. **Result-based Error Handling**
   ```rust
   // Using Result for operations that might fail
   pub async fn load_texture(&mut self, name: &str) -> Result<Texture2D, String> {
       // Implementation with error handling
   }
   ```

### Code Style Preferences
1. Comprehensive documentation with doc comments
2. Clear module organization with explicit visibility
3. Strong typing with enums for state representation
4. Structured error handling with descriptive messages
5. Asynchronous code for I/O operations

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
1. Macroquad provides good abstractions for 2D rendering but requires careful management for complex UIs
2. Asset loading is a critical performance area, especially for web deployment
3. State management complexity increases with game progression
4. Cross-platform considerations must be addressed early in the development process

### Project Evolution
1. Starting with core navigation and UI before implementing complex game mechanics
2. Building reusable components to accelerate development
3. Focusing on authentic recreation while incorporating modern software practices
4. Establishing solid foundation before adding detailed game mechanics

### Discovered Original Game Behavior
1. The original game uses a straightforward state machine for screen navigation
2. Assets are loaded on demand with specific loading screens
3. UI interactions are primarily mouse-driven with keyboard shortcuts
4. Game progression follows a linear path with branching decision points
